# Feature Band Support: Work Plan

This document builds on top of [Managing SDK Bands](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/main/docs/VMR-Managing-SDK-Bands.md) with a concrete work plan for providing feature band support in the VMR. Please read that doc as a prerequisite.

Document convention:
* There can be a variable number of feature band releases (e.g. 10.0.1xx, 10.0.2xx, 10.0.3xx, etc). For purposes of this document, we mainly care about the distinction between the 1xx branch and all the other non-1xx feature band branches. For simplicity, 2xx will be used as a notation to mean any non-1xx feature band branch.

## Plan Details

### Branch Management

The 2xx branch sources should accurately reflect what gets produced in the output. Since the shared component are only being produced in the 1xx branch, those associated repos will be excluded from the 2xx branch upon creation. The benefits of of removing the source include the following:
* Avoids confusion about which source is relevant in the production of the build
* Avoids the need to determine if or when repo sources should be updated with the latest from the 1xx branch.
* Avoids any compliance issues with the code getting stale if it hasn't been updated (e.g. CodeQL alerts).

Rather than deleting the associated projects in the `repo-projects` directory, it may make sense to keep those and trim the dependency graph of `RepositoryReferences` using a condition based on whether it's the 1xx branch or not.

There should be tooling to help with this exclusion process for the VMR maintainers. This can potentially be integrated into the broader workflow that is necessary when branching such as branding updates and pipeline changes. The tooling could potentially make use of the dependency graph described by the `repo-projects` directory to determine which repos need to be removed.

### Dependency Flow

Repos in the 2xx+ branches of the VMR which have dependencies on repos solely defined in the 1xx branch (e.g. `sdk` repo's dependency on `runtime`) will need to have some sort of dependency flow that moves the output of the 1xx build to the 2xx++ builds.

    participant runtime as dotnet/runtime<br />release/10.0
    participant VMR_1xx as VMR<br />release/10.0.1xx
    participant VMR_2xx as VMR<br />release/10.0.2xx
    participant VMR_3xx as VMR<br />release/10.0.3xx

    runtime->>VMR_1xx: Flow of runtime change
    Note over VMR_1xx: üì¶ VMR build output packages are built
    VMR_1xx->>VMR_2xx: Dependency flow <br />(runtime build output packages)
    VMR_1xx->>VMR_3xx: Dependency flow <br />(runtime build output packages)
```

This could be done a few different ways, but there are some explicit goals that point in a specific direction:
- **Repeatability** - The product produced from the 2xx++ branches should not vary in a meaningful way if the source has not changed.
- **Speed** - The time/number of steps required to build 2xx+ should be minimized.
- **Distro partner/MSFT build unification** - We should minimize differences between the distro partner and MSFT builds.

To achieve 2xx+ builds, we will use the "classic" dependency flow methodology that .NET has used for many years. The VMR's root `Version.Details.xml`/`Versions.props` files will be updated to include all dependencies used to "bootstrap" the .NET build. This includes 1xx branches. *Note: Despite having a reduced set of repos, 2xx+ branches will not have a "reduced" set of dependencies.* The intention here is that this is essentially a representation of the "previously source-built" concept that is present in source-build. We are just extending this concept to Microsoft's distribution, and making the representation explicit.

When building a repo within the VMR, the following version flow will be applied:

```mermaid

  VerProps[Import Versions.props]
  ImportPVP[<b>Override with Previous.Versions.Props</b><br/><br/><i>Includes versions of assets from root VMR's Version.Details.xml file that are also present in the repo's Version.Details.xml</i>]
  ImportCVP[<b>Override with Current.Versions.Props</b><br/><br/><i>Includes versions of assets built during the current VMR build that are also present in the repo's Version.Details.xml</i>]
  VerProps-->ImportPVP-->ImportCVP
```

- Import Versions.props
- Import generated Previous.Versions.props -
  - Includes versions of assets from root VMR's Version.Details.xml file that are also present in the repo's `Version.Details.xml`
- Import generated Current.Versions.props - 
  - Includes versions of assets built during the current VMR build that are also present in the repo's `Version.Details.xml`

**Considerations**

- **Validation of 2xx+ repos** - A repo is validated on backflow based on what it built against. So a 1xx SDK repo branch receives the source changes in the 1xx VMR sdk sources, as well as the outputs of the VMR build, which includes the runtime that the SDK built against in that VMR build. This means that on backflow, the SDK PR is validating the SDK's sources against the updated SDK dependencies. For 2xx+ branches, only a subset of outputs is produced, so a backflow PR would not include all the dependencies that the 2xx SDK needs. To deal with this, we will attempt to use the CoherentParentDependency feature. CoherentParentDependency attributes will be placed on the SDK dependencies that are not produced in the 2xx build, tying them to a dependency produced in the 2xx build. When backflow happens and the dependencies are updated for a repo, the CPDs will resolve to the versions specific in the root VMR Version.Details.xml if they are not produced in the current build.
- **Distro partner previously-source-built update process** - Right now distro partners will build a given release by taking a set of previously SB artifacts (provided by MS or source-built by the distro partner), and pass these to the build script via --with-packages and --with-sdk. Going forward, this step will either be preceded by an explicit step to update the root `Version.Details.xml` with these packages, or this switch will imply such a step. Therefore, when the build is running, the previously source-built inputs and their versions are specified by the `Version.Details.xml` file, and NuGet will find those packages in the directory passed via --with-packages. Essentially, we are eliminating some implicit behavior.

### Toolset

‚ùì Open Question:
A policy is needed which defines what toolset version each feature band branch can have. For example, should all feature band branches be required to use only the 1xx toolset? Can there be a mix of some using 1xx while others use a higher version?

### Build

* In addition to NuGet package, we also need to provide a way to have access to the runtime and ASP.NET Core artifacts (e.g. `dotnet-runtime-<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz`) from 2xx branches. This is necessary for the SDK to be able to bundle things together. This should be able to be done using https://ci.dot.net, just as it is done in product repo builds.
* Since Arcade repo will not be available, all repos will need to use the bootstrap Arcade (`UseBootstrapArcade=true`).
* While the `scenario-tests` repo doesn't have differing code for each feature band, it will still need to exist in each of the VMR's feature band branches because it is built as part of the pipeline run and used to validate the product. This is ok since it is not part of the shipped binaries.

‚ùì Open Question:
There will need to be some way to detect when we are in one of these 2xx branches. What mechanism should be used for that? Maybe checking `packageVersion` of the sdk in `source-manifest.json`?

‚ùì Open Question:
How to handle the multi-pass build legs where they are dependent on a shared component (e.g. `Windows_x86_BuildPass2`, `Windows_x64_BuildPass2`, `Windows_Workloads_x64_BuildPass2`)?

#### Source-Only Builds

For source-only builds, you're going to need to build all the source, including the source from the 1xx branch in order to produce a release from a 2xx branch.

There are a variety of scenarios to consider:

1. Has the distro maintainer produced any 1xx assets before from the previous release?
    * If yes:
      * Build 1xx branch using artifacts and SDK from previous 1xx release as input
    * If no:
      * Build 1xx branch using Microsoft artifacts and SDK
      * Rebuild 1xx branch using output of first build as input
1. Is this the initial release of the feature band (e.g. 10.0.200)?
    * If yes:
      * Build 2xx branch using output of 1xx artifacts and SDK as input
    * If no:
      * Has the distro maintainer produced any 2xx assets before from the previous release?
        * If yes:
          * Build 2xx branch using artifacts and SDK from previous 2xx release as input
        * If no:
          * Build 2xx branch using Microsoft artifacts and source-built 1xx artifacts as input
          * Rebuild 2xx branch using output of first build as input

The assertion with these scenarios is that a minimum of 2 and maximum of 4 builds is required to produce source built output for a 2xx feature band. It will never be necessary to depend on any other feature band besides 1xx and the target feature band. For example, it would never be necessary for a distro maintainer to build the 3xx feature band in order to source build the 4xx feature band.

In order to facilitate the actions that will need to be taken by a distro maintainer or developer, new scripts should be provided (or existing ones updated). Specifically, provide a way to combine the output artifacts from multiple builds to be used as input.

‚ùì Open Question:

Should a distro maintainer be required to build the *entire* 1xx branch VMR (including the SDK)? That's easier to implement but also potentially wasteful if they're not going to be producing a release for that feature branch. Otherwise, there'd need to be some way to filter which repos get built such that only the repos excluded from the 2xx branch get built.

##### Poison Leak Detection

Source build [poison leak detection](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/blob/main/Documentation/leak-detection.md) will need to exclude all files that originate from packages produced by the 1xx branch. For example, the `System.Xml.dll` file included in the 2xx SDK originates from the 1xx branch. The intention of poison leak detection is to enforce that all source-built files can be serviceable. In the case of shared components coming from the 1xx branch, it is inherently true that they are serviceable in that branch. And they can then be safely redistributed in the 2xx branch.

### UB Pipeline Changes

#### Microsoft Build Legs

Some of the Microsoft build legs will need to be trimmed from the 2xx branch. Specifically, there are short stack and cross-OS DAC builds that only build the runtime repo. These would not be relevant for the 2xx branch and should be excluded in the pipeline.

#### Source-Only Build Legs

Given that the packages outputted from the 1xx branch are needed in order to source build the 2xx branch, changes will be needed to the pipelines.

In order to make the build efficient, we can collect the output of the 1xx branch's official build and feed that in as input to the 2xx branch build. There's no need to build the 1xx branch again from source since it's already been done. This requires publishing source build intermediate packages for each repo in the VMR pipeline. Those packages can then be restored as part of the repos that depend on them within the 2xx branch.

### Source Build Release

The Source Build release pipeline requires updating to handle multiple VMR branches.
