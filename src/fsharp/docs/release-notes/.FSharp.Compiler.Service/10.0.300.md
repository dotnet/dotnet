* Fixed semantic classification regression where copy-and-update record fields were colored as type names, and union case tester dot was colored as union case. ([PR #19311](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19311))
* Fix false FS1182 (unused variable) warning for query expression variables used in where, let, join, and select clauses. ([Issue #422](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/422))
* Fix FS0229 B-stream misalignment when reading metadata from assemblies compiled with LangVersion < 9.0, introduced by [#17706](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17706). ([PR #19260](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19260))

### Added
* FSharpType: add ImportILType ([PR #19300](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19300))

### Changed

* Centralized product TFM (Target Framework Moniker) into MSBuild props file `eng/TargetFrameworks.props`. Changing the target framework now only requires editing one file, and it integrates with MSBuild's `--getProperty` for scripts.
* Overload resolution results are now cached, providing compile time improvements for code with repeated method calls. ([Issue #18807](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18807))
* Symbols: safer qualified name getting ([PR #19298](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19298))
