### Fixed

* Fix FS0229 B-stream misalignment when reading metadata from assemblies compiled with LangVersion < 9.0, introduced by [#17706](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17706). ([PR #19260](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19260))
* Fix FS3356 false positive for instance extension members with same name on different types, introduced by [#18821](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18821). ([PR #19260](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19260))

### Added

### Changed

* Centralized product TFM (Target Framework Moniker) into MSBuild props file `eng/TargetFrameworks.props`. Changing the target framework now only requires editing one file, and it integrates with MSBuild's `--getProperty` for scripts.
