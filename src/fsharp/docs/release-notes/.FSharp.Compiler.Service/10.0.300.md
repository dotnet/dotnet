### Added
* FSharpType: add ImportILType ([PR #19300](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19300))

### Changed

* Centralized product TFM (Target Framework Moniker) into MSBuild props file `eng/TargetFrameworks.props`. Changing the target framework now only requires editing one file, and it integrates with MSBuild's `--getProperty` for scripts.
