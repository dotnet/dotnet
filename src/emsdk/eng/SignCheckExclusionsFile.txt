;; Format: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/397316e195639450b6c76bfeb9823b40bee72d6d/src/SignCheck/Microsoft.SignCheck/Verification/Exclusion.cs#L23-L35
;;
;; This issue tracks a way to implement exclusions via Signing.props and avoid this extra file: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/2888
*.js;;We don't need to code sign .js files because they are not used in Windows Script Host
*.exe;*.whl;The .whl files are not supported by ESRP, https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/53252
libbinaryen.dylib;;fails to sign via ESRP, skip for now
