// This is a port of the Python version of wcwidth() written by Jeff Quast,
// which originally was written by Markus Kuhn.

//
// In fixed-width output devices, Latin characters all occupy a single "cell" position
// of equal width, whereas ideographic CJK characters occupy two such cells. Interoperability
// between terminal-line applications and (teletype-style) character terminals using the
// UTF-8 encoding requires agreement on which character should advance the cursor by how
// many cell positions. No established formal standards exist at present on which Unicode
// character shall occupy how many cell positions on character terminals. These routines
// are a first attempt of defining such behavior based on simple rules applied to data
// provided by the Unicode Consortium.
//
// For some graphical characters, the Unicode standard explicitly defines a character-cell
// width via the definition of the East Asian FullWidth (F), Wide (W), Half-width (H),
// and Narrow (Na) classes. In all these cases, there is no ambiguity about which width
// a terminal shall use. For characters in the East Asian Ambiguous (A) class, the width
// choice depends purely on a preference of backward compatibility with either historic
// CJK or Western practice. Choosing single-width for these characters is easy to justify
// as the appropriate long-term solution, as the CJK practice of displaying these characters
// as double-width comes from historic implementation simplicity (8-bit encoded characters
// were displayed single-width and 16-bit ones double-width, even for Greek, Cyrillic, etc.)
// and not any typographic considerations.
//
// Much less clear is the choice of width for the Not East Asian (Neutral) class.
// Existing practice does not dictate a width for any of these characters. It would
// nevertheless make sense typographically to allocate two character cells to characters
// such as for instance EM SPACE or VOLUME INTEGRAL, which cannot be represented adequately
// with a single-width glyph. The following routines at present merely assign a single-cell
// width to all neutral characters, in the interest of simplicity. This is not entirely
// satisfactory and should be reconsidered before establishing a formal standard in this area.
// At the moment, the decision which Not East Asian (Neutral) characters should be represented
// by double-width glyphs cannot yet be answered by applying a simple rule from the Unicode
// database content. Setting up a proper standard for the behavior of UTF-8 character
// terminals will require a careful analysis not only of each Unicode character, but also
// of each presentation form, something the author of these routines has avoided to do so far.
