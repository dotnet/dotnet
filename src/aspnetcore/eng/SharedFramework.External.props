      Transitive dependencies of other assemblies in the shared framework. These are listed separately and should not be included directly
      when setting `<Reference>`. These are listed for the purpose of tests and servicing builds only.

      If implementation details change and these assemblies are no longer showing up in the shared framework as a result of that,
      it is okay to remove these transitive dependencies.

      If these are needed as direct dependencies, it is okay to change them to ExternalAspNetCoreAppReference and move up into sections above.

      Seems arbitrary that the following packages have their ref/ assemblies in our targeting pack but the above assemblies

      Once we start to build a servicing release, hoist transitive dependencies to be direct dependencies.

      the original direct dependency that pulled in the transitive reference.
