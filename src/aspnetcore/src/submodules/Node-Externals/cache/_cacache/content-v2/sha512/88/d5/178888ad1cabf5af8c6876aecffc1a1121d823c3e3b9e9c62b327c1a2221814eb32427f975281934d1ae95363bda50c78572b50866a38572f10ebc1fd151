Webpack\n\n**webpack-merge** provides a `merge` function that concatenates arrays and merges objects creating a new object. If functions are encountered, it will execute them, run the results through the algorithm, and then wrap the returned values within a function again.\n\nThis behavior is particularly useful in configuring webpack although it has uses beyond it. Whenever you need to merge configuration objects, **webpack-merge** can come in handy.\n\n## Standard Merging\n\n### **`merge(...configuration | [...configuration])`**\n\n`merge` is the core, and the most important idea, of the API. Often this is all you need unless you want further customization.\n\n```javascript\nimport { merge } from 'webpack-merge';\n\n// Default API\nconst output = merge(object1, object2, object3, ...);\n\n// You can pass an array of objects directly.\n// This works with all available functions.\nconst output = merge([object1, object2, object3]);\n\n// Keys matching to the right take precedence:\nconst output = merge(\n  { fruit: \"apple\", color: \"red\" },\n  { fruit: \"strawberries\" }\n);\nconsole.log(output);\n// { color: \"red\", fruit: \"strawberries\"}\n```\n\n> Note that `Promise`s are not supported! If you want to return a configuration wrapped within a `Promise`, `merge` inside one. Example: `Promise.resolve(merge({ ... }, { ... }))`.\n\n### **`mergeWithCustomize({ customizeArray, customizeObject })(...configuration | [...configuration])`**\n\n`merge` behavior can be customized per field as below:\n\n```javascript\nimport { mergeWithCustomize } from 'webpack-merge';\n\nconst output = mergeWithCustomize(\n  {\n    customizeArray(a, b, key) {\n      if (key === 'extensions') {\n        return _.uniq([...a, ...b]);\n      }\n\n      // Fall back to default merging\n      return undefined;\n    },\n    customizeObject(a, b, key) {\n      if (key === 'module') {\n        // Custom merging\n        return _.merge({}, a, b);\n      }\n\n      // Fall back to default merging\n      return undefined;\n    }\n  }\n)(object1, object2, object3, ...);\n```\n\nFor example, if the previous code was invoked with only `object1` and `object2`\nwith `object1` as:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    foo1: ['object1'],\n    foo2: ['object1'],\n    bar1: { object1: {} },\n    bar2: { object1: {} },\n}\n```\n\nand `object2` as:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    foo1: ['object2'],\n    foo2: ['object2'],\n    bar1: { object2: {} },\n    bar2: { object2: {} },\n}\n```\n\nthen `customizeArray` will be invoked for each property of `Array` type, i.e:\n\n```javascript\ncustomizeArray([\"object1\"], [\"object2\"], \"foo1\");\ncustomizeArray([\"object1\"], [\"object2\"], \"foo2\");\n```\n\nand `customizeObject` will be invoked for each property of `Object` type, i.e:\n\n```javascript\ncustomizeObject({ object1: {} }, { object2: {} }, bar1);\ncustomizeObject({ object1: {} }, { object2: {} }, bar2);\n```\n\n### **`unique(<field>, <fields>, field => field)`**\n\nThe first `<field>` is the config property to look through for duplicates.\n\n`<fields>` represents the values that should be unique when you run the field => field function on each duplicate.\n\n```javascript\nimport { mergeWithCustomize, unique } from \"webpack-merge\";\n\nconst output = mergeWithCustomize({\n  customizeArray: unique(\n    \"plugins\",\n    [\"HotModuleReplacementPlugin\"],\n    (plugin) => plugin.constructor && plugin.constructor.name\n  ),\n})(\n  {\n    plugins: [new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()],\n  },\n  {\n    plugins: [new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()],\n  }\n);\n\n// Output contains only single HotModuleReplacementPlugin now.\n```\n\n### **`customizeArray`** and **`customizeObject`**\n\n`customizeArray` and `customizeObject` provide small strategies to for `mergeWithCustomize`. They support `append`, `prepend`, `replace`, and wildcards for field names.\n\n```javascript\nimport { mergeWithCustomize, customizeArray, customizeObject } from 'webpack-merge';\n\nconst output = mergeWithCustomize({\n  customizeArray: customizeArray({\n    'entry.*': 'prepend'\n  }),\n  customizeObject: customizeObject({\n    entry: 'prepend'\n  })\n})(object1, object2, object3, ...);\n```\n\n> Check out [SurviveJS - Webpack](http://survivejs.com/) to dig deeper into the topic.\n\n## Development\n\n1. `npm i`\n1. `npm t -- --watch`\n\nBefore contributing, please open an issue where to discuss.\n\n## Contributors\n\n### Code Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.
