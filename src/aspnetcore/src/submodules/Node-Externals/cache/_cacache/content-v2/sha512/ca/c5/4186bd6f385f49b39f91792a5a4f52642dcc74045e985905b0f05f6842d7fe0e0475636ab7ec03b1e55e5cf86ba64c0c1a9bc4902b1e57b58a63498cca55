tough-cookie\n\n[RFC 6265](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) Cookies and CookieJar for Node.js\n\n[![npm package](https://nodei.co/npm/tough-cookie.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/tough-cookie/)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/salesforce/tough-cookie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/salesforce/tough-cookie)\n\n## Synopsis\n\n```javascript\nvar tough = require('tough-cookie')\nvar Cookie = tough.Cookie\nvar cookie = Cookie.parse(header)\ncookie.value = 'somethingdifferent'\nheader = cookie.toString()\nvar cookiejar = new tough.CookieJar()\n\n// Asynchronous!\nvar cookie = await cookiejar.setCookie(\n  cookie,\n  'https://currentdomain.example.com/path',\n)\nvar cookies = await cookiejar.getCookies('https://example.com/otherpath')\n\n// Or with callbacks!\ncookiejar.setCookie(\n  cookie,\n  'https://currentdomain.example.com/path',\n  function (err, cookie) {\n    /* ... */\n  },\n)\ncookiejar.getCookies('http://example.com/otherpath', function (err, cookies) {\n  /* ... */\n})\n```\n\nWhy the name? NPM modules `cookie`, `cookies` and `cookiejar` were already taken.\n\n## Installation\n\nIt's _so_ easy! Install with `npm` or your preferred package manager.\n\n```sh\nnpm install tough-cookie\n```\n\n## Node.js Version Support\n\nWe follow the [node.js release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) and support all versions that are in Active LTS or Maintenance. We will always do a major release when dropping support for older versions of node, and we will do so in consultation with our community.\n\n## API\n\n### tough\n\nThe top-level exports from `require('tough-cookie')` can all be used as pure functions and don't need to be bound.\n\n#### `parseDate(string)`\n\nParse a cookie date string into a `Date`. Parses according to [RFC 6265 Section 5.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.1.1), not `Date.parse()`.\n\n#### `formatDate(date)`\n\nFormat a `Date` into an [RFC 822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822#section-5) string (the RFC 6265 recommended format).\n\n#### `canonicalDomain(str)`\n\nTransforms a domain name into a canonical domain name. The canonical domain name is a domain name that has been trimmed, lowercased, stripped of leading dot, and optionally punycode-encoded ([Section 5.1.2 of RFC 6265](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.1.2)). For the most part, this function is idempotent (calling the function with the output from a previous call returns the same output).\n\n#### `domainMatch(str, domStr[, canonicalize=true])`\n\nAnswers \"does this real domain match the domain in a cookie?\". The `str` is the \"current\" domain name and the `domStr` is the \"cookie\" domain name. Matches according to [RFC 6265 Section 5.1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.1.3), but it helps to think of it as a \"suffix match\".\n\nThe `canonicalize` parameter toggles whether the domain parameters get normalized with `canonicalDomain` or not.\n\n#### `defaultPath(path)`\n\nGiven a current request/response path, gives the path appropriate for storing in a cookie. This is basically the \"directory\" of a \"file\" in the path, but is specified by [Section 5.1.4 of the RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.1.4).\n\nThe `path` parameter MUST be _only_ the pathname part of a URI (excluding the hostname, query, fragment, and so on). This is the `.pathname` property of node's `uri.parse()` output.\n\n#### `pathMatch(reqPath, cookiePath)`\n\nAnswers \"does the request-path path-match a given cookie-path?\" as per [RFC 6265 Section 5.1.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.1.4). Returns a boolean.\n\nThis is essentially a prefix-match where `cookiePath` is a prefix of `reqPath`.\n\n#### `parse(cookieString[, options])`\n\nAlias for [`Cookie.parse(cookieString[, options])`](#cookieparsecookiestring-options).\n\n#### `fromJSON(string)`\n\nAlias for [`Cookie.fromJSON(string)`](#cookiefromjsonstrorobj).\n\n#### `getPublicSuffix(hostname)`\n\nReturns the public suffix of this hostname. The public suffix is the shortest domain name upon which a cookie can be set. Returns `null` if the hostname cannot have cookies set for it.\n\nFor example: `www.example.com` and `www.subdomain.example.com` both have public suffix `example.com`.\n\nFor further information, see the [Public Suffix List](http://publicsuffix.org/). This module derives its list from that site. This call is a wrapper around [`psl`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/psl)'s [`get` method](https://www.npmjs.com/package/psl##pslgetdomain).\n\n#### `cookieCompare(a, b)`\n\nFor use with `.sort()`, sorts a list of cookies into the recommended order given in step 2 of ([RFC 6265 Section 5.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.4)). The sort algorithm is, in order of precedence:\n\n- Longest `.path`\n- oldest `.creation` (which has a 1-ms precision, same as `Date`)\n- lowest `.creationIndex` (to get beyond the 1-ms precision)\n\n```javascript\nvar cookies = [\n  /* unsorted array of Cookie objects */\n]\ncookies = cookies.sort(cookieCompare)\n```\n\n> **Note**: Since the JavaScript `Date` is limited to a 1-ms precision, cookies within the same millisecond are entirely possible. This is especially true when using the `now` option to `.setCookie()`. The `.creationIndex` property is a per-process global counter, assigned during construction with `new Cookie()`, which preserves the spirit of the RFC sorting: older cookies go first. This works great for `MemoryCookieStore` since `Set-Cookie` headers are parsed in order, but is not so great for distributed systems. Sophisticated `Store`s may wish to set this to some other _logical clock_ so that if cookies A and B are created in the same millisecond, but cookie A is created before cookie B, then `A.creationIndex < B.creationIndex`. If you want to alter the global counter, which you probably _shouldn't_ do, it's stored in `Cookie.cookiesCreated`.\n\n#### `permuteDomain(domain)`\n\nGenerates a list of all possible domains that `domainMatch()` the parameter. Can be handy for implementing cookie stores.\n\n#### `permutePath(path)`\n\nGenerates a list of all possible paths that `pathMatch()` the parameter. Can be handy for implementing cookie stores.\n\n### Cookie\n\nExported via `tough.Cookie`.\n\n#### `Cookie.parse(cookieString[, options])`\n\nParses a single Cookie or Set-Cookie HTTP header into a `Cookie` object. Returns `undefined` if the string can't be parsed.\n\nThe options parameter is not required and currently has only one property:\n\n- _loose_ - boolean - if `true` enable parsing of keyless cookies like `=abc` and `=`, which are not RFC-compliant.\n\nIf options is not an object it is ignored, which means it can be used with [`Array#map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map).\n\nTo process the Set-Cookie header(s) on a node HTTP/HTTPS response:\n\n```javascript\nif (Array.isArray(res.headers['set-cookie']))\n  cookies = res.headers['set-cookie'].map(Cookie.parse)\nelse cookies = [Cookie.parse(res.headers['set-cookie'])]\n```\n\n_Note:_ In version 2.3.3, tough-cookie limited the number of spaces before the `=` to 256 characters. This limitation was removed in version 2.3.4.\nFor more details, see [issue #92](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/issues/92).\n\n#### Properties\n\nCookie object properties:\n\n- _key_ - string - the name or key of the cookie (default `\"\"`)\n- _value_ - string - the value of the cookie (default `\"\"`)\n- _expires_ - `Date` - if set, the `Expires=` attribute of the cookie (defaults to the string `\"Infinity\"`). See `setExpires()`\n- _maxAge_ - seconds - if set, the `Max-Age=` attribute _in seconds_ of the cookie. Can also be set to strings `\"Infinity\"` and `\"-Infinity\"` for non-expiry and immediate-expiry, respectively. See `setMaxAge()`\n- _domain_ - string - the `Domain=` attribute of the cookie\n- _path_ - string - the `Path=` of the cookie\n- _secure_ - boolean - the `Secure` cookie flag\n- _httpOnly_ - boolean - the `HttpOnly` cookie flag\n- _sameSite_ - string - the `SameSite` cookie attribute (from [RFC 6265bis](#rfc-6265bis)); must be one of `none`, `lax`, or `strict`\n- _extensions_ - `Array` - any unrecognized cookie attributes as strings (even if equal-signs inside)\n- _creation_ - `Date` - when this cookie was constructed\n- _creationIndex_ - number - set at construction, used to provide greater sort precision (see `cookieCompare(a,b)` for a full explanation)\n\nAfter a cookie has been passed through `CookieJar.setCookie()` it has the following additional attributes:\n\n- _hostOnly_ - boolean - is this a host-only cookie (that is, no Domain field was set, but was instead implied).\n- _pathIsDefault_ - boolean - if true, there was no Path field on the cookie and `defaultPath()` was used to derive one.\n- _creation_ - `Date` - **modified** from construction to when the cookie was added to the jar.\n- _lastAccessed_ - `Date` - last time the cookie got accessed. Affects cookie cleaning after it is implemented. Using `cookiejar.getCookies(...)` updates this attribute.\n\n#### `new Cookie([properties])`\n\nReceives an options object that can contain any of the above Cookie properties. Uses the default for unspecified properties.\n\n#### `.toString()`\n\nEncodes to a Set-Cookie header value. The Expires cookie field is set using `formatDate()`, but is omitted entirely if `.expires` is `Infinity`.\n\n#### `.cookieString()`\n\nEncodes to a Cookie header value (specifically, the `.key` and `.value` properties joined with `\"=\"`).\n\n#### `.setExpires(string)`\n\nSets the expiry based on a date-string passed through `parseDate()`. If parseDate returns `null` (that is, can't parse this date string), `.expires` is set to `\"Infinity\"` (a string).\n\n#### `.setMaxAge(number)`\n\nSets the maxAge in seconds. Coerces `-Infinity` to `\"-Infinity\"` and `Infinity` to `\"Infinity\"` so it correctly serializes to JSON.\n\n#### `.expiryDate([now=Date.now()])`\n\n`expiryTime()` computes the absolute unix-epoch milliseconds that this cookie expires. `expiryDate()` works similarly, except it returns a `Date` object. Note that in both cases the `now` parameter should be milliseconds.\n\nMax-Age takes precedence over Expires (as per the RFC). The `.creation` attribute -- or, by default, the `now` parameter -- is used to offset the `.maxAge` attribute.\n\nIf Expires (`.expires`) is set, that's returned.\n\nOtherwise, `expiryTime()` returns `Infinity` and `expiryDate()` returns a `Date` object for \"Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT\" (latest date that can be expressed by a 32-bit `time_t`; the common limit for most user-agents).\n\n#### `.TTL([now=Date.now()])`\n\nComputes the TTL relative to `now` (milliseconds). The same precedence rules as for `expiryTime`/`expiryDate` apply.\n\n`Infinity` is returned for cookies without an explicit expiry and `0` is returned if the cookie is expired. Otherwise a time-to-live in milliseconds is returned.\n\n#### `.canonicalizedDomain()`\n\n#### `.cdomain()`\n\nReturns the canonicalized `.domain` field. This is lower-cased and punycode ([RFC 3490](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3490)) encoded if the domain has any non-ASCII characters.\n\n#### `.toJSON()`\n\nFor convenience in using `JSON.serialize(cookie)`. Returns a plain-old `Object` that can be JSON-serialized.\n\nAny `Date` properties (such as `.expires`, `.creation`, and `.lastAccessed`) are exported in ISO format (`.toISOString()`).\n\n> **NOTE**: Custom `Cookie` properties are discarded. In tough-cookie 1.x, since there was no `.toJSON` method explicitly defined, all enumerable properties were captured. If you want a property to be serialized, add the property name to the `Cookie.serializableProperties` Array.\n\n#### `Cookie.fromJSON(strOrObj)`\n\nDoes the reverse of `cookie.toJSON()`. If passed a string, will `JSON.parse()` that first.\n\nAny `Date` properties (such as `.expires`, `.creation`, and `.lastAccessed`) are parsed via [`Date.parse`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse), not tough-cookie's `parseDate`, since ISO timestamps are being handled at this layer.\n\nReturns `null` upon a JSON parsing error.\n\n#### `.clone()`\n\nDoes a deep clone of this cookie, implemented exactly as `Cookie.fromJSON(cookie.toJSON())`.\n\n#### `.validate()`\n\nStatus: _IN PROGRESS_. Works for a few things, but is by no means comprehensive.\n\nValidates cookie attributes for semantic correctness. Useful for \"lint\" checking any Set-Cookie headers you generate. For now, it returns a boolean, but eventually could return a reason string. Future-proof with this construct:\n\n```javascript\nif (cookie.validate() === true) {\n  // it's tasty\n} else {\n  // yuck!\n}\n```\n\n### CookieJar\n\nExported via `tough.CookieJar`.\n\n#### `CookieJar([store][, options])`\n\nSimply use `new CookieJar()`. If a custom store is not passed to the constructor, a [`MemoryCookieStore`](#memorycookiestore) is created and used.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n- _rejectPublicSuffixes_ - boolean - default `true` - reject cookies with domains like \"com\" and \"co.uk\"\n- _looseMode_ - boolean - default `false` - accept malformed cookies like `bar` and `=bar`, which have an implied empty name.\n- _prefixSecurity_ - string - default `silent` - set to `'unsafe-disabled'`, `'silent'`, or `'strict'`. See [Cookie Prefixes](#cookie-prefixes) below.\n- _allowSpecialUseDomain_ - boolean - default `true` - accepts special-use domain suffixes, such as `local`. Useful for testing purposes.\n  This is not in the standard, but is used sometimes on the web and is accepted by most browsers.\n\n#### `.setCookie(cookieOrString, currentUrl[, options][, callback(err, cookie)])`\n\nAttempt to set the cookie in the cookie jar. The cookie has updated `.creation`, `.lastAccessed` and `.hostOnly` properties. And returns a promise if a callback is not provided.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n- _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API. Affects `HttpOnly` cookies.\n- _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from URL - indicates if this is a \"Secure\" API. If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` this defaults to `true`, otherwise `false`.\n- _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation or access time of cookies.\n- _ignoreError_ - boolean - default `false` - silently ignore things like parse errors and invalid domains. `Store` errors aren't ignored by this option.\n- _sameSiteContext_ - string - default unset - set to `'none'`, `'lax'`, or `'strict'` See [SameSite Cookies](#samesite-cookies) below.\n\nAs per the RFC, the `.hostOnly` property is set if there was no \"Domain=\" parameter in the cookie string (or `.domain` was null on the Cookie object). The `.domain` property is set to the fully-qualified hostname of `currentUrl` in this case. Matching this cookie requires an exact hostname match (not a `domainMatch` as per usual).\n\n#### `.setCookieSync(cookieOrString, currentUrl[, options])`\n\nSynchronous version of [`setCookie`](#setcookiecookieorstring-currenturl-options-callbackerr-cookie); only works with synchronous stores (that is, the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n#### `.getCookies(currentUrl[, options][, callback(err, cookies)])`\n\nRetrieve the list of cookies that can be sent in a Cookie header for the current URL. Returns a promise if a callback is not provided.\n\nReturns an array of `Cookie` objects, sorted by default using [`cookieCompare`](#cookiecomparea-b).\n\nIf an error is encountered it's passed as `err` to the callback, otherwise an array of `Cookie` objects is passed. The array is sorted with `cookieCompare()` unless the `{sort:false}` option is given.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n- _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API. Affects `HttpOnly` cookies.\n- _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from URL - indicates if this is a \"Secure\" API. If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.\n- _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation or access time of cookies\n- _expire_ - boolean - default `true` - perform expiry-time checking of cookies and asynchronously remove expired cookies from the store. Using `false` returns expired cookies and does **not** remove them from the store (which is potentially useful for replaying Set-Cookie headers).\n- _allPaths_ - boolean - default `false` - if `true`, do not scope cookies by path. The default uses RFC-compliant path scoping. **Note**: may not be supported by the underlying store (the default `MemoryCookieStore` supports it).\n- _sameSiteContext_ - string - default unset - Set this to `'none'`, `'lax'`, or `'strict'` to enforce SameSite cookies upon retrieval. See [SameSite Cookies](#samesite-cookies) below.\n- _sort_ - boolean - whether to sort the list of cookies.\n\nThe `.lastAccessed` property of the returned cookies will have been updated.\n\n#### `.getCookiesSync(currentUrl, [{options}])`\n\nSynchronous version of [`getCookies`](#getcookiescurrenturl-options-callbackerr-cookies); only works with synchronous stores (for example, the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n#### `.getCookieString(...)`\n\nAccepts the same options as [`.getCookies()`](#getcookiescurrenturl-options-callbackerr-cookies) but returns a string suitable for a Cookie header rather than an Array.\n\n#### `.getCookieStringSync(...)`\n\nSynchronous version of [`getCookieString`](#getcookiestring); only works with synchronous stores (for example, the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n#### `.getSetCookieStrings(...)`\n\nReturns an array of strings suitable for **Set-Cookie** headers. Accepts the same options as [`.getCookies()`](#getcookiescurrenturl-options-callbackerr-cookies). Simply maps the cookie array via `.toString()`.\n\n#### `.getSetCookieStringsSync(...)`\n\nSynchronous version of [`getSetCookieStrings`](#getsetcookiestrings); only works with synchronous stores (for example, the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n#### `.serialize([callback(err, serializedObject)])`\n\nReturns a promise if a callback is not provided.\n\nSerialize the Jar if the underlying store supports `.getAllCookies`.\n\n> **NOTE**: Custom `Cookie` properties are discarded. If you want a property to be serialized, add the property name to the `Cookie.serializableProperties` Array.\n\nSee [Serialization Format](#serialization-format).\n\n#### `.serializeSync()`\n\nSynchronous version of [`serialize`](#serializecallbackerr-serializedobject); only works with synchronous stores (for example, the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n#### `.toJSON()`\n\nAlias of [`.serializeSync()`](#serializesync) for the convenience of `JSON.stringify(cookiejar)`.\n\n#### `CookieJar.deserialize(serialized[, store][, callback(err, object)])`\n\nA new Jar is created and the serialized Cookies are added to the underlying store. Each `Cookie` is added via `store.putCookie` in the order in which they appear in the serialization. A promise is returned if a callback is not provided.\n\nThe `store` argument is optional, but should be an instance of `Store`. By default, a new instance of `MemoryCookieStore` is created.\n\nAs a convenience, if `serialized` is a string, it is passed through `JSON.parse` first.\n\n#### `CookieJar.deserializeSync(serialized[, store])`\n\nSync version of [`.deserialize`](#cookiejardeserializeserialized-store-callbackerr-object); only works with synchronous stores (for example, the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n#### `CookieJar.fromJSON(string)`\n\nAlias of [`.deserializeSync`](#cookiejardeserializesyncserialized-store) to provide consistency with [`Cookie.fromJSON()`](#cookiefromjsonstrorobj).\n\n#### `.clone([store][, callback(err, cloned))`\n\nProduces a deep clone of this jar. Modifications to the original do not affect the clone, and vice versa. Returns a promise if a callback is not provided.\n\nThe `store` argument is optional, but should be an instance of `Store`. By default, a new instance of `MemoryCookieStore` is created. Transferring between store types is supported so long as the source implements `.getAllCookies()` and the destination implements `.putCookie()`.\n\n#### `.cloneSync([store])`\n\nSynchronous version of [`.clone`](#clonestore-callbackerr-cloned), returning a new `CookieJar` instance.\n\nThe `store` argument is optional, but must be a _synchronous_ `Store` instance if specified. If not passed, a new instance of `MemoryCookieStore` is used.\n\nThe _source_ and _destination_ must both be synchronous `Store`s. If one or both stores are asynchronous, use `.clone` instead. Recall that `MemoryCookieStore` supports both synchronous and asynchronous API calls.\n\n#### `.removeAllCookies([callback(err)])`\n\nRemoves all cookies from the jar. Returns a promise if a callback is not provided.\n\nThis is a new backwards-compatible feature of `tough-cookie` version 2.5, so not all Stores will implement it efficiently. For Stores that do not implement `removeAllCookies`, the fallback is to call `removeCookie` after `getAllCookies`. If `getAllCookies` fails or isn't implemented in the Store, that error is returned. If one or more of the `removeCookie` calls fail, only the first error is returned.\n\n#### `.removeAllCookiesSync()`\n\nSync version of [`.removeAllCookies()`](#removeallcookiescallbackerr); only works with synchronous stores (for example, the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n### Store\n\nBase class for CookieJar stores. Available as `tough.Store`.\n\n### Store API\n\nThe storage model for each `CookieJar` instance can be replaced with a custom implementation. The default is `MemoryCookieStore` which can be found in [`lib/memstore.js`](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/blob/master/lib/memstore.js). The API uses continuation-passing-style to allow for asynchronous stores.\n\nStores should inherit from the base `Store` class, which is available as a top-level export.\n\nStores are asynchronous by default, but if `store.synchronous` is set to `true`, then the `*Sync` methods of the containing `CookieJar` can be used.\n\nAll `domain` parameters are normalized before calling.\n\nThe Cookie store must have all of the following methods. Note that asynchronous implementations **must** support callback parameters.\n\n#### `store.findCookie(domain, path, key, callback(err, cookie))`\n\nRetrieve a cookie with the given domain, path, and key (name). The RFC maintains that exactly one of these cookies should exist in a store. If the store is using versioning, this means that the latest or newest such cookie should be returned.\n\nCallback takes an error and the resulting `Cookie` object. If no cookie is found then `null` MUST be passed instead (that is, not an error).\n\n#### `store.findCookies(domain, path, allowSpecialUseDomain, callback(err, cookies))`\n\nLocates cookies matching the given domain and path. This is most often called in the context of [`cookiejar.getCookies()`](#getcookiescurrenturl-options-callbackerr-cookies).\n\nIf no cookies are found, the callback MUST be passed an empty array.\n\nThe resulting list is checked for applicability to the current request according to the RFC (domain-match, path-match, http-only-flag, secure-flag, expiry, and so on), so it's OK to use an optimistic search algorithm when implementing this method. However, the search algorithm used SHOULD try to find cookies that `domainMatch()` the domain and `pathMatch()` the path in order to limit the amount of checking that needs to be done.\n\nAs of version 0.9.12, the `allPaths` option to `cookiejar.getCookies()` above causes the path here to be `null`. If the path is `null`, path-matching MUST NOT be performed (that is, domain-matching only).\n\n#### `store.putCookie(cookie, callback(err))`\n\nAdds a new cookie to the store. The implementation SHOULD replace any existing cookie with the same `.domain`, `.path`, and `.key` properties. Depending on the nature of the implementation, it's possible that between the call to `fetchCookie` and `putCookie` that a duplicate `putCookie` can occur.\n\nThe `cookie` object MUST NOT be modified; as the caller has already updated the `.creation` and `.lastAccessed` properties.\n\nPass an error if the cookie cannot be stored.\n\n#### `store.updateCookie(oldCookie, newCookie, callback(err))`\n\nUpdate an existing cookie. The implementation MUST update the `.value` for a cookie with the same `domain`, `.path`, and `.key`. The implementation SHOULD check that the old value in the store is equivalent to `oldCookie` - how the conflict is resolved is up to the store.\n\nThe `.lastAccessed` property is always different between the two objects (to the precision possible via JavaScript's clock). Both `.creation` and `.creationIndex` are guaranteed to be the same. Stores MAY ignore or defer the `.lastAccessed` change at the cost of affecting how cookies are selected for automatic deletion (for example, least-recently-used, which is up to the store to implement).\n\nStores may wish to optimize changing the `.value` of the cookie in the store versus storing a new cookie. If the implementation doesn't define this method, a stub that calls [`putCookie`](#storeputcookiecookie-callbackerr) is added to the store object.\n\nThe `newCookie` and `oldCookie` objects MUST NOT be modified.\n\nPass an error if the newCookie cannot be stored.\n\n#### `store.removeCookie(domain, path, key, callback(err))`\n\nRemove a cookie from the store (see notes on [`findCookie`](#storefindcookiedomain-path-key-callbackerr-cookie) about the uniqueness constraint).\n\nThe implementation MUST NOT pass an error if the cookie doesn't exist, and only pass an error due to the failure to remove an existing cookie.\n\n#### `store.removeCookies(domain, path, callback(err))`\n\nRemoves matching cookies from the store. The `path` parameter is optional and if missing, means all paths in a domain should be removed.\n\nPass an error ONLY if removing any existing cookies failed.\n\n#### `store.removeAllCookies(callback(err))`\n\n_Optional_. Removes all cookies from the store.\n\nPass an error if one or more cookies can't be removed.\n\n#### `store.getAllCookies(callback(err, cookies))`\n\n_Optional_. Produces an `Array` of all cookies during [`jar.serialize()`](#serializecallbackerr-serializedobject). The items in the array can be true `Cookie` objects or generic `Object`s with the [Serialization Format](#serialization-format) data structure.\n\nCookies SHOULD be returned in creation order to preserve sorting via [`compareCookie()`](#cookiecomparea-b). For reference, `MemoryCookieStore` sorts by `.creationIndex` since it uses true `Cookie` objects internally. If you don't return the cookies in creation order, they'll still be sorted by creation time, but this only has a precision of 1-ms. See `cookieCompare` for more detail.\n\nPass an error if retrieval fails.\n\n**Note**: Not all Stores can implement this due to technical limitations, so it is optional.\n\n### MemoryCookieStore\n\nInherits from `Store`.\n\nA just-in-memory CookieJar synchronous store implementation, used by default. Despite being a synchronous implementation, it's usable with both the synchronous and asynchronous forms of the `CookieJar` API. Supports serialization, `getAllCookies`, and `removeAllCookies`.\n\n### Community Cookie Stores\n\nThese are some Store implementations authored and maintained by the community. They aren't official and we don't vouch for them but you may be interested to have a look:\n\n- [`db-cookie-store`](https://github.com/JSBizon/db-cookie-store): SQL including SQLite-based databases\n- [`file-cookie-store`](https://github.com/JSBizon/file-cookie-store): Netscape cookie file format on disk\n- [`redis-cookie-store`](https://github.com/benkroeger/redis-cookie-store): Redis\n- [`tough-cookie-filestore`](https://github.com/mitsuru/tough-cookie-filestore): JSON on disk\n- [`tough-cookie-web-storage-store`](https://github.com/exponentjs/tough-cookie-web-storage-store): DOM localStorage and sessionStorage\n\n## Serialization Format\n\n**NOTE**: If you want to have custom `Cookie` properties serialized, add the property name to `Cookie.serializableProperties`.\n\n```js\n  {\n    // The version of tough-cookie that serialized this jar.\n    version: 'tough-cookie@1.x.y',\n\n    // add the store type, to make humans happy:\n    storeType: 'MemoryCookieStore',\n\n    // CookieJar configuration:\n    rejectPublicSuffixes: true,\n    // ... future items go here\n\n    // Gets filled from jar.store.getAllCookies():\n    cookies: [\n      {\n        key: 'string',\n        value: 'string',\n        // ...\n        /* other Cookie.serializableProperties go here */\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n```\n\n## RFC 6265bis\n\nSupport for RFC 6265bis revision 02 is being developed. Since this is a bit of an omnibus revision to the RFC 6252, support is broken up into the functional areas.\n\n### Leave Secure Cookies Alone\n\nNot yet supported.\n\nThis change makes it so that if a cookie is sent from the server to the client with a `Secure` attribute, the channel must also be secure or the cookie is ignored.\n\n### SameSite Cookies\n\nSupported.\n\nThis change makes it possible for servers, and supporting clients, to mitigate certain types of CSRF attacks by disallowing `SameSite` cookies from being sent cross-origin.\n\nOn the Cookie object itself, you can get or set the `.sameSite` attribute, which is serialized into the `SameSite=` cookie attribute. When unset or `undefined`, no `SameSite=` attribute is serialized. The valid values of this attribute are `'none'`, `'lax'`, or `'strict'`. Other values are serialized as-is.\n\nWhen parsing cookies with a `SameSite` cookie attribute, values other than `'lax'` or `'strict'` are parsed as `'none'`. For example, `SomeCookie=SomeValue; SameSite=garbage` parses so that `cookie.sameSite === 'none'`.\n\nIn order to support SameSite cookies, you must provide a `sameSiteContext` option to _both_ `setCookie` and `getCookies`. Valid values for this option are just like for the Cookie object, but have particular meanings:\n\n1. `'strict'` mode - If the request is on the same \"site for cookies\" (see the RFC draft for more information), pass this option to add a layer of defense against CSRF.\n2. `'lax'` mode - If the request is from another site, _but_ is directly because of navigation by the user, such as, `<link type=prefetch>` or `<a href=\"...\">`, pass `sameSiteContext: 'lax'`.\n3. `'none'` - Otherwise, pass `sameSiteContext: 'none'` (this indicates a cross-origin request).\n4. unset/`undefined` - SameSite **is not** be enforced! This can be a valid use-case for when CSRF isn't in the threat model of the system being built.\n\nIt is highly recommended that you read RFC 6265bis for fine details on SameSite cookies. In particular [Section 8.8](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-02##section-8.8) discusses security considerations and defense in depth.\n\n### Cookie Prefixes\n\nSupported.\n\nCookie prefixes are a way to indicate that a given cookie was set with a set of attributes simply by inspecting the first few characters of the cookie's name.\n\nCookie prefixes are defined in [Section 4.1.3 of 6265bis](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-03##section-4.1.3).\n\nTwo prefixes are defined:\n\n1. `\"__Secure-\" Prefix`: If a cookie's name begins with a case-sensitive match for the string \"\\_\\_Secure-\", then the cookie was set with a \"Secure\" attribute.\n2. `\"__Host-\" Prefix`: If a cookie's name begins with a case-sensitive match for the string \"\\_\\_Host-\", then the cookie was set with a \"Secure\" attribute, a \"Path\" attribute with a value of \"/\", and no \"Domain\" attribute.\n\nIf `prefixSecurity` is enabled for `CookieJar`, then cookies that match the prefixes defined above but do not obey the attribute restrictions are not added.\n\nYou can define this functionality by passing in the `prefixSecurity` option to `CookieJar`. It can be one of 3 values:\n\n1. `silent`: Enable cookie prefix checking but silently fail to add the cookie if conditions are not met. Default.\n2. `strict`: Enable cookie prefix checking and error out if conditions are not met.\n3. `unsafe-disabled`: Disable cookie prefix checking.\n\nNote that if `ignoreError` is passed in as `true` then the error is silent regardless of the `prefixSecurity` option (assuming it's enabled).\n\n## Copyright and License\n\nBSD-3-Clause:\n\n```text\n Copyright (c) 2015, Salesforce.com, Inc.\n All rights reserved.\n\n Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n 1.

NPM modules `cookie`, `cookies` and `cookiejar` were already taken.\n\n## Installation\n\nIt's _so_ easy! Install with `npm` or your preferred package manager.\n\n```sh\nnpm install tough-cookie\n```\n\n## Node.js Version Support\n\nWe follow the [node.js release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) and support all versions that are in Active LTS or Maintenance. We will always do a major release when dropping support for older versions of node, and we will do so in consultation with our community.\n\n## API\n\n### tough\n\nThe top-level exports from `require('tough-cookie')` can all be used as pure functions and don't need to be bound.\n\n#### `parseDate(string)`\n\nParse a cookie date string into a `Date`. Parses according to [RFC 6265 Section 5.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.1.1), not `Date.parse()`.\n\n#### `formatDate(date)`\n\nFormat a `Date` into an [RFC 822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822#section-5) string (the RFC 6265 recommended format).\n\n#### `canonicalDomain(str)`\n\nTransforms a domain name into a canonical domain name. The canonical domain name is a domain name that has been trimmed, lowercased, stripped of leading dot, and optionally punycode-encoded ([Section 5.1.2 of RFC 6265](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.1.2)). For the most part, this function is idempotent (calling the function with the output from a previous call returns the same output).\n\n#### `domainMatch(str, domStr[, canonicalize=true])`\n\nAnswers \"does this real domain match the domain in a cookie?\". The `str` is the \"current\" domain name and the `domStr` is the \"cookie\" domain name. Matches according to [RFC 6265 Section 5.1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.1.3), but it helps to think of it as a \"suffix match\".\n\nThe `canonicalize` parameter toggles whether the domain parameters get normalized with `canonicalDomain` or not.\n\n#### `defaultPath(path)`\n\nGiven a current request/response path, gives the path appropriate for storing in a cookie. This is basically the \"directory\" of a \"file\" in the path, but is specified by [Section 5.1.4 of the RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.1.4).\n\nThe `path` parameter MUST be _only_ the pathname part of a URI (excluding the hostname, query, fragment, and so on). This is the `.pathname` property of node's `uri.parse()` output.\n\n#### `pathMatch(reqPath, cookiePath)`\n\nAnswers \"does the request-path path-match a given cookie-path?\" as per [RFC 6265 Section 5.1.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.1.4). Returns a boolean.\n\nThis is essentially a prefix-match where `cookiePath` is a prefix of `reqPath`.\n\n#### `parse(cookieString[, options])`\n\nAlias for [`Cookie.parse(cookieString[, options])`](#cookieparsecookiestring-options).\n\n#### `fromJSON(string)`\n\nAlias for [`Cookie.fromJSON(string)`](#cookiefromjsonstrorobj).\n\n#### `getPublicSuffix(hostname)`\n\nReturns the public suffix of this hostname. The public suffix is the shortest domain name upon which a cookie can be set. Returns `null` if the hostname cannot have cookies set for it.\n\nFor example: `www.example.com` and `www.subdomain.example.com` both have public suffix `example.com`.\n\nFor further information, see the [Public Suffix List](http://publicsuffix.org/). This module derives its list from that site. This call is a wrapper around [`psl`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/psl)'s [`get` method](https://www.npmjs.com/package/psl##pslgetdomain).\n\n#### `cookieCompare(a, b)`\n\nFor use with `.sort()`, sorts a list of cookies into the recommended order given in step 2 of ([RFC 6265 Section 5.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.4)). The sort algorithm is, in order of precedence:\n\n- Longest `.path`\n- oldest `.creation` (which has a 1-ms precision, same as `Date`)\n- lowest `.creationIndex` (to get beyond the 1-ms precision)\n\n```javascript\nvar cookies = [\n  /* unsorted array of Cookie objects */\n]\ncookies = cookies.sort(cookieCompare)\n```\n\n> **Note**: Since the JavaScript `Date` is limited to a 1-ms precision, cookies within the same millisecond are entirely possible. This is especially true when using the `now` option to `.setCookie()`. The `.creationIndex` property is a per-process global counter, assigned during construction with `new Cookie()`, which preserves the spirit of the RFC sorting: older cookies go first. This works great for `MemoryCookieStore` since `Set-Cookie` headers are parsed in order, but is not so great for distributed systems. Sophisticated `Store`s may wish to set this to some other _logical clock_ so that if cookies A and B are created in the same millisecond, but cookie A is created before cookie B, then `A.creationIndex < B.creationIndex`. If you want to alter the global counter, which you probably _shouldn't_ do, it's stored in `Cookie.cookiesCreated`.\n\n#### `permuteDomain(domain)`\n\nGenerates a list of all possible domains that `domainMatch()` the parameter. Can be handy for implementing cookie stores.\n\n#### `permutePath(path)`\n\nGenerates a list of all possible paths that `pathMatch()` the parameter. Can be handy for implementing cookie stores.\n\n### Cookie\n\nExported via `tough.Cookie`.\n\n#### `Cookie.parse(cookieString[, options])`\n\nParses a single Cookie or Set-Cookie HTTP header into a `Cookie` object. Returns `undefined` if the string can't be parsed.\n\nThe options parameter is not required and currently has only one property:\n\n- _loose_ - boolean - if `true` enable parsing of keyless cookies like `=abc` and `=`, which are not RFC-compliant.\n\nIf options is not an object it is ignored, which means it can be used with [`Array#map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map).\n\nTo process the Set-Cookie header(s) on a node HTTP/HTTPS response:\n\n```javascript\nif (Array.isArray(res.headers['set-cookie']))\n  cookies = res.headers['set-cookie'].map(Cookie.parse)\nelse cookies = [Cookie.parse(res.headers['set-cookie'])]\n```\n\n_Note:_ In version 2.3.3, tough-cookie limited the number of spaces before the `=` to 256 characters. This limitation was removed in version 2.3.4.\nFor more details, see [issue #92](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/issues/92).\n\n#### Properties\n\nCookie object properties:\n\n- _key_ - string - the name or key of the cookie (default `\"\"`)\n- _value_ - string - the value of the cookie (default `\"\"`)\n- _expires_ - `Date` - if set, the `Expires=` attribute of the cookie (defaults to the string `\"Infinity\"`). See `setExpires()`\n- _maxAge_ - seconds - if set, the `Max-Age=` attribute _in seconds_ of the cookie. Can also be set to strings `\"Infinity\"` and `\"-Infinity\"` for non-expiry and immediate-expiry, respectively. See `setMaxAge()`\n- _domain_ - string - the `Domain=` attribute of the cookie\n- _path_ - string - the `Path=` of the cookie\n- _secure_ - boolean - the `Secure` cookie flag\n- _httpOnly_ - boolean - the `HttpOnly` cookie flag\n- _sameSite_ - string - the `SameSite` cookie attribute (from [RFC 6265bis](#rfc-6265bis)); must be one of `none`, `lax`, or `strict`\n- _extensions_ - `Array` - any unrecognized cookie attributes as strings (even if equal-signs inside)\n- _creation_ - `Date` - when this cookie was constructed\n- _creationIndex_ - number - set at construction, used to provide greater sort precision (see `cookieCompare(a,b)` for a full explanation)\n\nAfter a cookie has been passed through `CookieJar.setCookie()` it has the following additional attributes:\n\n- _hostOnly_ - boolean - is this a host-only cookie (that is, no Domain field was set, but was instead implied).\n- _pathIsDefault_ - boolean - if true, there was no Path field on the cookie and `defaultPath()` was used to derive one.\n- _creation_ - `Date` - **modified** from construction to when the cookie was added to the jar.\n- _lastAccessed_ - `Date` - last time the cookie got accessed. Affects cookie cleaning after it is implemented. Using `cookiejar.getCookies(...)` updates this attribute.\n\n#### `new Cookie([properties])`\n\nReceives an options object that can contain any of the above Cookie properties. Uses the default for unspecified properties.\n\n#### `.toString()`\n\nEncodes to a Set-Cookie header value. The Expires cookie field is set using `formatDate()`, but is omitted entirely if `.expires` is `Infinity`.\n\n#### `.cookieString()`\n\nEncodes to a Cookie header value (specifically, the `.key` and `.value` properties joined with `\"=\"`).\n\n#### `.setExpires(string)`\n\nSets the expiry based on a date-string passed through `parseDate()`. If parseDate returns `null` (that is, can't parse this date string), `.expires` is set to `\"Infinity\"` (a string).\n\n#### `.setMaxAge(number)`\n\nSets the maxAge in seconds. Coerces `-Infinity` to `\"-Infinity\"` and `Infinity` to `\"Infinity\"` so it correctly serializes to JSON.\n\n#### `.expiryDate([now=Date.now()])`\n\n`expiryTime()` computes the absolute unix-epoch milliseconds that this cookie expires. `expiryDate()` works similarly, except it returns a `Date` object. Note that in both cases the `now` parameter should be milliseconds.\n\nMax-Age takes precedence over Expires (as per the RFC). The `.creation` attribute -- or, by default, the `now` parameter -- is used to offset the `.maxAge` attribute.\n\nIf Expires (`.expires`) is set, that's returned.\n\nOtherwise, `expiryTime()` returns `Infinity` and `expiryDate()` returns a `Date` object for \"Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT\" (latest date that can be expressed by a 32-bit `time_t`; the common limit for most user-agents).\n\n#### `.TTL([now=Date.now()])`\n\nComputes the TTL relative to `now` (milliseconds). The same precedence rules as for `expiryTime`/`expiryDate` apply.\n\n`Infinity` is returned for cookies without an explicit expiry and `0` is returned if the cookie is expired. Otherwise a time-to-live in milliseconds is returned.\n\n#### `.canonicalizedDomain()`\n\n#### `.cdomain()`\n\nReturns the canonicalized `.domain` field. This is lower-cased and punycode ([RFC 3490](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3490)) encoded if the domain has any non-ASCII characters.\n\n#### `.toJSON()`\n\nFor convenience in using `JSON.stringify(cookie)`. Returns a plain-old `Object` that can be JSON-serialized.\n\nAny `Date` properties (such as `.expires`, `.creation`, and `.lastAccessed`) are exported in ISO format (`.toISOString()`).\n\n> **NOTE**: Custom `Cookie` properties are discarded. In tough-cookie 1.x, since there was no `.toJSON` method explicitly defined, all enumerable properties were captured. If you want a property to be serialized, add the property name to the `Cookie.serializableProperties` Array.\n\n#### `Cookie.fromJSON(strOrObj)`\n\nDoes the reverse of `cookie.toJSON()`. If passed a string, will `JSON.parse()` that first.\n\nAny `Date` properties (such as `.expires`, `.creation`, and `.lastAccessed`) are parsed via [`Date.parse`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse), not tough-cookie's `parseDate`, since ISO timestamps are being handled at this layer.\n\nReturns `null` upon a JSON parsing error.\n\n#### `.clone()`\n\nDoes a deep clone of this cookie, implemented exactly as `Cookie.fromJSON(cookie.toJSON())`.\n\n#### `.validate()`\n\nStatus: _IN PROGRESS_. Works for a few things, but is by no means comprehensive.\n\nValidates cookie attributes for semantic correctness. Useful for \"lint\" checking any Set-Cookie headers you generate. For now, it returns a boolean, but eventually could return a reason string. Future-proof with this construct:\n\n```javascript\nif (cookie.validate() === true) {\n  // it's tasty\n} else {\n  // yuck!\n}\n```\n\n### CookieJar\n\nExported via `tough.CookieJar`.\n\n#### `CookieJar([store][, options])`\n\nSimply use `new CookieJar()`. If a custom store is not passed to the constructor, a [`MemoryCookieStore`](#memorycookiestore) is created and used.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n- _rejectPublicSuffixes_ - boolean - default `true` - reject cookies with domains like \"com\" and \"co.uk\"\n- _looseMode_ - boolean - default `false` - accept malformed cookies like `bar` and `=bar`, which have an implied empty name.\n- _prefixSecurity_ - string - default `silent` - set to `'unsafe-disabled'`, `'silent'`, or `'strict'`. See [Cookie Prefixes](#cookie-prefixes) below.\n- _allowSpecialUseDomain_ - boolean - default `true` - accepts special-use domain suffixes, such as `local`. Useful for testing purposes.\n  This is not in the standard, but is used sometimes on the web and is accepted by most browsers.\n\n#### `.setCookie(cookieOrString, currentUrl[, options][, callback(err, cookie)])`\n\nAttempt to set the cookie in the cookie jar. The cookie has updated `.creation`, `.lastAccessed` and `.hostOnly` properties. And returns a promise if a callback is not provided.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n- _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API. Affects `HttpOnly` cookies.\n- _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from URL - indicates if this is a \"Secure\" API. If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` this defaults to `true`, otherwise `false`.\n- _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation or access time of cookies.\n- _ignoreError_ - boolean - default `false` - silently ignore things like parse errors and invalid domains. `Store` errors aren't ignored by this option.\n- _sameSiteContext_ - string - default unset - set to `'none'`, `'lax'`, or `'strict'` See [SameSite Cookies](#samesite-cookies) below.\n\nAs per the RFC, the `.hostOnly` property is set if there was no \"Domain=\" parameter in the cookie string (or `.domain` was null on the Cookie object). The `.domain` property is set to the fully-qualified hostname of `currentUrl` in this case. Matching this cookie requires an exact hostname match (not a `domainMatch` as per usual).\n\n#### `.setCookieSync(cookieOrString, currentUrl[, options])`\n\nSynchronous version of [`setCookie`](#setcookiecookieorstring-currenturl-options-callbackerr-cookie); only works with synchronous stores (that is, the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n#### `.getCookies(currentUrl[, options][, callback(err, cookies)])`\n\nRetrieve the list of cookies that can be sent in a Cookie header for the current URL. Returns a promise if a callback is not provided.\n\nReturns an array of `Cookie` objects, sorted by default using [`cookieCompare`](#cookiecomparea-b).\n\nIf an error is encountered it's passed as `err` to the callback, otherwise an array of `Cookie` objects is passed. The array is sorted with `cookieCompare()` unless the `{sort:false}` option is given.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n- _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API. Affects `HttpOnly` cookies.\n- _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from URL - indicates if this is a \"Secure\" API. If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.\n- _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation or access time of cookies\n- _expire_ - boolean - default `true` - perform expiry-time checking of cookies and asynchronously remove expired cookies from the store. Using `false` returns expired cookies and does **not** remove them from the store (which is potentially useful for replaying Set-Cookie headers).\n- _allPaths_ - boolean - default `false` - if `true`, do not scope cookies by path. The default uses RFC-compliant path scoping. **Note**: may not be supported by the underlying store (the default `MemoryCookieStore` supports it).\n- _sameSiteContext_ - string - default unset - Set this to `'none'`, `'lax'`, or `'strict'` to enforce SameSite cookies upon retrieval. See [SameSite Cookies](#samesite-cookies) below.\n- _sort_ - boolean - whether to sort the list of cookies.\n\nThe `.lastAccessed` property of the returned cookies will have been updated.\n\n#### `.getCookiesSync(currentUrl, [{options}])`\n\nSynchronous version of [`getCookies`](#getcookiescurrenturl-options-callbackerr-cookies); only works with synchronous stores (for example, the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n#### `.getCookieString(...)`\n\nAccepts the same options as [`.getCookies()`](#getcookiescurrenturl-options-callbackerr-cookies) but returns a string suitable for a Cookie header rather than an Array.\n\n#### `.getCookieStringSync(...)`\n\nSynchronous version of [`getCookieString`](#getcookiestring); only works with synchronous stores (for example, the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n#### `.getSetCookieStrings(...)`\n\nReturns an array of strings suitable for **Set-Cookie** headers. Accepts the same options as [`.getCookies()`](#getcookiescurrenturl-options-callbackerr-cookies). Simply maps the cookie array via `.toString()`.\n\n#### `.getSetCookieStringsSync(...)`\n\nSynchronous version of [`getSetCookieStrings`](#getsetcookiestrings); only works with synchronous stores (for example, the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n#### `.serialize([callback(err, serializedObject)])`\n\nReturns a promise if a callback is not provided.\n\nSerialize the Jar if the underlying store supports `.getAllCookies`.\n\n> **NOTE**: Custom `Cookie` properties are discarded. If you want a property to be serialized, add the property name to the `Cookie.serializableProperties` Array.\n\nSee [Serialization Format](#serialization-format).\n\n#### `.serializeSync()`\n\nSynchronous version of [`serialize`](#serializecallbackerr-serializedobject); only works with synchronous stores (for example, the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n#### `.toJSON()`\n\nAlias of [`.serializeSync()`](#serializesync) for the convenience of `JSON.stringify(cookiejar)`.\n\n#### `CookieJar.deserialize(serialized[, store][, callback(err, object)])`\n\nA new Jar is created and the serialized Cookies are added to the underlying store. Each `Cookie` is added via `store.putCookie` in the order in which they appear in the serialization. A promise is returned if a callback is not provided.\n\nThe `store` argument is optional, but should be an instance of `Store`. By default, a new instance of `MemoryCookieStore` is created.\n\nAs a convenience, if `serialized` is a string, it is passed through `JSON.parse` first.\n\n#### `CookieJar.deserializeSync(serialized[, store])`\n\nSync version of [`.deserialize`](#cookiejardeserializeserialized-store-callbackerr-object); only works with synchronous stores (for example, the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n#### `CookieJar.fromJSON(string)`\n\nAlias of [`.deserializeSync`](#cookiejardeserializesyncserialized-store) to provide consistency with [`Cookie.fromJSON()`](#cookiefromjsonstrorobj).\n\n#### `.clone([store][, callback(err, cloned))`\n\nProduces a deep clone of this jar. Modifications to the original do not affect the clone, and vice versa. Returns a promise if a callback is not provided.\n\nThe `store` argument is optional, but should be an instance of `Store`. By default, a new instance of `MemoryCookieStore` is created. Transferring between store types is supported so long as the source implements `.getAllCookies()` and the destination implements `.putCookie()`.\n\n#### `.cloneSync([store])`\n\nSynchronous version of [`.clone`](#clonestore-callbackerr-cloned), returning a new `CookieJar` instance.\n\nThe `store` argument is optional, but must be a _synchronous_ `Store` instance if specified. If not passed, a new instance of `MemoryCookieStore` is used.\n\nThe _source_ and _destination_ must both be synchronous `Store`s. If one or both stores are asynchronous, use `.clone` instead. Recall that `MemoryCookieStore` supports both synchronous and asynchronous API calls.\n\n#### `.removeAllCookies([callback(err)])`\n\nRemoves all cookies from the jar. Returns a promise if a callback is not provided.\n\nThis is a new backwards-compatible feature of `tough-cookie` version 2.5, so not all Stores will implement it efficiently. For Stores that do not implement `removeAllCookies`, the fallback is to call `removeCookie` after `getAllCookies`. If `getAllCookies` fails or isn't implemented in the Store, that error is returned. If one or more of the `removeCookie` calls fail, only the first error is returned.\n\n#### `.removeAllCookiesSync()`\n\nSync version of [`.removeAllCookies()`](#removeallcookiescallbackerr); only works with synchronous stores (for example, the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n### Store\n\nBase class for CookieJar stores. Available as `tough.Store`.\n\n### Store API\n\nThe storage model for each `CookieJar` instance can be replaced with a custom implementation. The default is `MemoryCookieStore` which can be found in [`lib/memstore.ts`](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/blob/master/lib/memstore.ts). The API uses continuation-passing-style to allow for asynchronous stores.\n\nStores should inherit from the base `Store` class, which is available as a top-level export.\n\nStores are asynchronous by default, but if `store.synchronous` is set to `true`, then the `*Sync` methods of the containing `CookieJar` can be used.\n\nAll `domain` parameters are normalized before calling.\n\nThe Cookie store must have all of the following methods. Note that asynchronous implementations **must** support callback parameters.\n\n#### `store.findCookie(domain, path, key, callback(err, cookie))`\n\nRetrieve a cookie with the given domain, path, and key (name). The RFC maintains that exactly one of these cookies should exist in a store. If the store is using versioning, this means that the latest or newest such cookie should be returned.\n\nCallback takes an error and the resulting `Cookie` object. If no cookie is found then `null` MUST be passed instead (that is, not an error).\n\n#### `store.findCookies(domain, path, allowSpecialUseDomain, callback(err, cookies))`\n\nLocates cookies matching the given domain and path. This is most often called in the context of [`cookiejar.getCookies()`](#getcookiescurrenturl-options-callbackerr-cookies).\n\nIf no cookies are found, the callback MUST be passed an empty array.\n\nThe resulting list is checked for applicability to the current request according to the RFC (domain-match, path-match, http-only-flag, secure-flag, expiry, and so on), so it's OK to use an optimistic search algorithm when implementing this method. However, the search algorithm used SHOULD try to find cookies that `domainMatch()` the domain and `pathMatch()` the path in order to limit the amount of checking that needs to be done.\n\nAs of version 0.9.12, the `allPaths` option to `cookiejar.getCookies()` above causes the path here to be `null`. If the path is `null`, path-matching MUST NOT be performed (that is, domain-matching only).\n\n#### `store.putCookie(cookie, callback(err))`\n\nAdds a new cookie to the store. The implementation SHOULD replace any existing cookie with the same `.domain`, `.path`, and `.key` properties. Depending on the nature of the implementation, it's possible that between the call to `fetchCookie` and `putCookie` that a duplicate `putCookie` can occur.\n\nThe `cookie` object MUST NOT be modified; as the caller has already updated the `.creation` and `.lastAccessed` properties.\n\nPass an error if the cookie cannot be stored.\n\n#### `store.updateCookie(oldCookie, newCookie, callback(err))`\n\nUpdate an existing cookie. The implementation MUST update the `.value` for a cookie with the same `domain`, `.path`, and `.key`. The implementation SHOULD check that the old value in the store is equivalent to `oldCookie` - how the conflict is resolved is up to the store.\n\nThe `.lastAccessed` property is always different between the two objects (to the precision possible via JavaScript's clock). Both `.creation` and `.creationIndex` are guaranteed to be the same. Stores MAY ignore or defer the `.lastAccessed` change at the cost of affecting how cookies are selected for automatic deletion (for example, least-recently-used, which is up to the store to implement).\n\nStores may wish to optimize changing the `.value` of the cookie in the store versus storing a new cookie. If the implementation doesn't define this method, a stub that calls [`putCookie`](#storeputcookiecookie-callbackerr) is added to the store object.\n\nThe `newCookie` and `oldCookie` objects MUST NOT be modified.\n\nPass an error if the newCookie cannot be stored.\n\n#### `store.removeCookie(domain, path, key, callback(err))`\n\nRemove a cookie from the store (see notes on [`findCookie`](#storefindcookiedomain-path-key-callbackerr-cookie) about the uniqueness constraint).\n\nThe implementation MUST NOT pass an error if the cookie doesn't exist, and only pass an error due to the failure to remove an existing cookie.\n\n#### `store.removeCookies(domain, path, callback(err))`\n\nRemoves matching cookies from the store. The `path` parameter is optional and if missing, means all paths in a domain should be removed.\n\nPass an error ONLY if removing any existing cookies failed.\n\n#### `store.removeAllCookies(callback(err))`\n\n_Optional_. Removes all cookies from the store.\n\nPass an error if one or more cookies can't be removed.\n\n#### `store.getAllCookies(callback(err, cookies))`\n\n_Optional_. Produces an `Array` of all cookies during [`jar.serialize()`](#serializecallbackerr-serializedobject). The items in the array can be true `Cookie` objects or generic `Object`s with the [Serialization Format](#serialization-format) data structure.\n\nCookies SHOULD be returned in creation order to preserve sorting via [`compareCookie()`](#cookiecomparea-b). For reference, `MemoryCookieStore` sorts by `.creationIndex` since it uses true `Cookie` objects internally. If you don't return the cookies in creation order, they'll still be sorted by creation time, but this only has a precision of 1-ms. See `cookieCompare` for more detail.\n\nPass an error if retrieval fails.\n\n**Note**: Not all Stores can implement this due to technical limitations, so it is optional.\n\n### MemoryCookieStore\n\nInherits from `Store`.\n\nA just-in-memory CookieJar synchronous store implementation, used by default. Despite being a synchronous implementation, it's usable with both the synchronous and asynchronous forms of the `CookieJar` API. Supports serialization, `getAllCookies`, and `removeAllCookies`.\n\n## Serialization Format\n\n**NOTE**: If you want to have custom `Cookie` properties serialized, add the property name to `Cookie.serializableProperties`.\n\n```js\n  {\n    // The version of tough-cookie that serialized this jar.\n    version: 'tough-cookie@1.x.y',\n\n    // add the store type, to make humans happy:\n    storeType: 'MemoryCookieStore',\n\n    // CookieJar configuration:\n    rejectPublicSuffixes: true,\n    // ... future items go here\n\n    // Gets filled from jar.store.getAllCookies():\n    cookies: [\n      {\n        key: 'string',\n        value: 'string',\n        // ...\n        /* other Cookie.serializableProperties go here */\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n```\n\n## RFC 6265bis\n\nSupport for RFC 6265bis revision 02 is being developed. Since this is a bit of an omnibus revision to the RFC 6252, support is broken up into the functional areas.\n\n### Leave Secure Cookies Alone\n\nNot yet supported.\n\nThis change makes it so that if a cookie is sent from the server to the client with a `Secure` attribute, the channel must also be secure or the cookie is ignored.\n\n### SameSite Cookies\n\nSupported.\n\nThis change makes it possible for servers, and supporting clients, to mitigate certain types of CSRF attacks by disallowing `SameSite` cookies from being sent cross-origin.\n\nOn the Cookie object itself, you can get or set the `.sameSite` attribute, which is serialized into the `SameSite=` cookie attribute. When unset or `undefined`, no `SameSite=` attribute is serialized. The valid values of this attribute are `'none'`, `'lax'`, or `'strict'`. Other values are serialized as-is.\n\nWhen parsing cookies with a `SameSite` cookie attribute, values other than `'lax'` or `'strict'` are parsed as `'none'`. For example, `SomeCookie=SomeValue; SameSite=garbage` parses so that `cookie.sameSite === 'none'`.\n\nIn order to support SameSite cookies, you must provide a `sameSiteContext` option to _both_ `setCookie` and `getCookies`. Valid values for this option are just like for the Cookie object, but have particular meanings:\n\n1. `'strict'` mode - If the request is on the same \"site for cookies\" (see the RFC draft for more information), pass this option to add a layer of defense against CSRF.\n2. `'lax'` mode - If the request is from another site, _but_ is directly because of navigation by the user, such as, `<link type=prefetch>` or `<a href=\"...\">`, pass `sameSiteContext: 'lax'`.\n3. `'none'` - Otherwise, pass `sameSiteContext: 'none'` (this indicates a cross-origin request).\n4. unset/`undefined` - SameSite **is not** be enforced! This can be a valid use-case for when CSRF isn't in the threat model of the system being built.\n\nIt is highly recommended that you read RFC 6265bis for fine details on SameSite cookies. In particular [Section 8.8](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-02##section-8.8) discusses security considerations and defense in depth.\n\n### Cookie Prefixes\n\nSupported.\n\nCookie prefixes are a way to indicate that a given cookie was set with a set of attributes simply by inspecting the first few characters of the cookie's name.\n\nCookie prefixes are defined in [Section 4.1.3 of 6265bis](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-03##section-4.1.3).\n\nTwo prefixes are defined:\n\n1. `\"__Secure-\" Prefix`: If a cookie's name begins with a case-sensitive match for the string \"\\_\\_Secure-\", then the cookie was set with a \"Secure\" attribute.\n2. `\"__Host-\" Prefix`: If a cookie's name begins with a case-sensitive match for the string \"\\_\\_Host-\", then the cookie was set with a \"Secure\" attribute, a \"Path\" attribute with a value of \"/\", and no \"Domain\" attribute.\n\nIf `prefixSecurity` is enabled for `CookieJar`, then cookies that match the prefixes defined above but do not obey the attribute restrictions are not added.\n\nYou can define this functionality by passing in the `prefixSecurity` option to `CookieJar`. It can be one of 3 values:\n\n1. `silent`: Enable cookie prefix checking but silently fail to add the cookie if conditions are not met. Default.\n2. `strict`: Enable cookie prefix checking and error out if conditions are not met.\n3. `unsafe-disabled`: Disable cookie prefix checking.\n\nNote that if `ignoreError` is passed in as `true` then the error is silent regardless of the `prefixSecurity` option (assuming it's enabled).\n\n## Copyright and License\n\nBSD-3-Clause:\n\n```text\n Copyright (c) 2015, Salesforce.com, Inc.\n All rights reserved.\n\n Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n 1.
